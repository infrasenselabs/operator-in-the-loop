_WIP..._

## Why is this written in Rust?

1. Static rather than dynamically-typed languages (like Python or Julia) offer the programmer [better control](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2020/08/13/types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types/).
2. Rust offers [self-contained binaries](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/v8nmcq/why_rust_for_general_application_development/), avoiding dependency conflict headaches of Python.
3. Rust is [committed to stability and safety](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2014/10/30/Stability/) as compared to Julia is often deployed [with correctness issues.](https://yuri.is/not-julia/) This probably reflects better top-down vision, commitment from maintainers, and -- in my opinion -- [longevity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3AdN7U24iU) and growth of the project.
4. Fast performance, concurrency control, and [error handling](https://mo8it.com/blog/rust-vs-julia/) (important for a real-time human-in-the-loop system).
5. Author has a personal interest in Rust ðŸ˜‰ and is interested to explore its potential for [application development](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/v8nmcq/why_rust_for_general_application_development/).
